This is for team 2: Jean and Courtney

These are instructions for applying FIGR to the synthetic five gene network
problem of the DREAM challenge benchmark (see
DREAM-FiveGeneNet1-Description.pdf).  I have created a branch called "reu2"
in the FIGR repository containing both the data and the code.


1. Switch to the reu2 branch:
    A. cd <your FIGR repository directory>
    B. git pull github reu2
    B. git checkout reu2


2. Start FigrApp.mlapp and load the files dream-fivegenenet1-xntg.txt and
dream-fivegenenet1-tt.txt in the expression data file name and timepoint file
name fields respectively. Load the data by clicking the "Load Files"
button.

3. Use the interface to choose appropriate values. There is only one
condition. Note that gene expression is oscillative in time, so the
undulations are real and not noise. Hint - you might have to choose a high
pSmoothing parameter such 0.5.

4. Save the options as EXACTLY this filename: dream-fivegenenet1-options.mda
using the "Save options..." button.

5. In the MATLAB command window start FIGR by typing
example6_dream_fivegenenet1 and hitting Enter/Return. This will take about
5 minutes to run.

6. The script will save the results in two files: dream-fivegenenet1-fits.pdf
and dream-fivegenenet1-Tmatrix.txt.

7. In your presentation you should show the fits in the PDF file (points
are experimental data and the line is computer simulation) and discuss how
the model's output compares to the data. 

8. You should also interpret the T matrix (in
dream-fivegenenet1-Tmatrix.txt)
- the rows are targets and the columns are regulators. The "Gold Standard"
  or the "ground truth" connections are given in
  GoldStandard_DIRECTED-SIGNED_EXCITATORY_FiveGene_qPCR.txt and
  GoldStandard_DIRECTED-SIGNED_INHIBITORY_FiveGene_qPCR.txt in the
  subdirectory FiveGeneNet1 of the FIGR repository directory. Please
  comment on how many FIGR got right and how many FIGR got wrong.
