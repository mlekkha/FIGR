## QUICK START GUIDE

1. Download all files into the same folder.
2. Start MATLAB and cd to the folder containing the files.
3. In the command line, run one of the example scripts provided, such as `example1-simple`.  The scripts print text in the Command Window and also pop-up a Figure window.
4. If desired, examine global variables generated by the scripts in the global workspace.  



## SCRIPTS, FUNCTIONS, AND DEPENDENCIES
```
  example1-simple.m     Illustrate FIGR for simple toy model with only 2 genes    
  example2-extreg.m     Illustrate FIGR for toy model with 2 genes + 1 external regulator   
  example3-fly.m        Illustrate FIGR for Drosophila data set (4+3 genes, 58 nuclei, 9 timepoints)    
  computeTrajs.m        Given GRN pars, initial conds, and timepoints, find gene expression trajectories 
      RateofChange.m    Called by computeTrajs()
  infer.m               Given gene expression trajectories, infer gene network parameters using FIGR
