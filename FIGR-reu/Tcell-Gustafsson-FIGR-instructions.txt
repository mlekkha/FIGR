This is for team 1: Neyda and Ashland

These are instructions for applying FIGR to the T-cell differentiation data
of Magnusson et al (2017).  I have created a branch called "reu" in the
FIGR repository containing both the data and the code.


1. Switch to the reu branch:
    A. cd <your FIGR repository directory>
    B. git pull github reu
    B. git checkout reu


2. Start FigrApp.mlapp and load the files tcell-gustafsson-xntg.txt and
tcell-gustafsson-tt.txt in the expression data file name and timepoint file
name fields respectively. Load the data by clicking the "Load Files"
button.

3. Use the interface to choose appropriate values. There are two
conditions: 8226 are Naive T cells that have not been differentiated into T
helper 2 (Th2) cells. 8227 are Th2 cells during their differentiation. Note
that if a gene is downregulated during Th2 differentiation, it should be
classified as "OFF" not "ON".

4. Save the options as EXACTLY this filename: tcell-gustafsson-options.mda
using the "Save options..." button.

5. In the MATLAB command window start FIGR by typing
example5_tcell_gustafsson and hitting Enter/Return. This will take about 10
minutes to run.

6. The script will save the results in two files: tcell-gustafsson-fits.pdf
and tcell-gustafsson-Tmatrix.txt.

7. In your presentation you should show the fits in the PDF file (points
are experimental data and the line is computer simulation) and discuss how
the model's output compares to the data. 

8. You should also interpret the T matrix (in tcell-gustafsson-Tmatrix.txt)
- the rows are targets and the columns are regulators and compare it to
  Fig. 2A of the Magnusson paper.
